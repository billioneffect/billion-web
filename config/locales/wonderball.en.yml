          <h1>Wonderball Supports Creativity</h1>
          <p>At the Columbus Museum of Art, we believe that creativity is for
          everyone. The JPMorgan Chase Center for Creativity empowers the
          imagination and gives opportunities for visitors of all ages to
          broaden their artistic horizons. Here, creativity is fostered,
          cultivated, championed, and celebrated.</p>

          <h4><strong>FOSTER</strong></h4>
          <p>SURGE: Teen Open Studio is a free drop-in program offering teens
            an open space to connect with peers and explore their
            interests.</p>

          <h4><strong>CULTIVATE</strong></h4>
          <p>Imagine That is a partnership with local Head Starts where
          Columbus Museum of Art collaborates with teachers in their classrooms
          to provide imaginative experiences for over 450 children each
          year.</p>

          <h4><strong>CHAMPION</strong></h4>
          <p>Columbus Museum of Art partners with creative people in our
          community to present intriguing and memorable experiences for
          visitors through the Connector Series.</p>

          <h4><strong>CELEBRATE</strong></h4>
          <p>Adults living with cognitive disabilities collectively created
          over 300 works of art this past year through the Museum’s Community
          Connections program.</p>
