            content: >
              <p>The Cap City Biohackers are dedicated to demystifying and
              democratizing science for people of all backgrounds. Founded in
              Columbus in 2015, we are a part of the world-wide DIYBio movement
              and the first established group in Ohio. We have formed a strong
              community around citizen science, including monthly lectures,
              discussions, and hands-on demonstrations.</p>

          - title: DIY Lab Equipment Hack
            content:
              <p>Our long-term goal is to create a biology lab that’s open to
              the community. The first step to this is stocking the lab with
              equipments. And because we want to provide those tools to as many
              people as possible, we need to rely upon the collective
              creativity of the people of Columbus.</p>

              <p>We want to get a long list of possible equipment hacks to
              choose from, not only so we can raise more money to sustain the
              group, but also so we can plan recurring meetings to come
              together and stock our lab full of awesome tools that we build
              ourselves.</p>
