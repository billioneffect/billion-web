Hi,

Thank you so much for participating in the Green Columbus campaign for Earth Day!

You have donated <%= number_to_currency @purchase.amount %> to the Earth Day Fund, awarding <%= @transaction.recipient.name %> with <%= number_with_delimiter @transaction.points %> points. If <%= @transaction.recipient.name %> finishes in the top 6 they will be performing at our annual Earth Day celebration in the Spring.

With your contribution, we can now purchase lots of supplies for our volunteer week. The Green Columbus Team greatly appreciates your support. Make sure to check back to see how your band is doing!

With regards,

The Green Columbus Team
