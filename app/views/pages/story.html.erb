          <p>Hi World Changer,</p>

          <p>We are Billion. We are the world’s first tournament style crowdfunding
          platform and we want to change the world. But before we tell you what’s
          happening in Columbus, Ohio, we want to tell you a little bit about us.</p>

          <p>It started with a passion to do good in the world. If you only pay
          the slightest attention today,  you know that there are immense issues
          in the world that need to be solved, issues that impact millions of
          people, if not billions. Why does human trafficking still exist? Why do
          we live in an age where the technology exists to grow organs, yet we
          still live on a dying planet? We wanted to let people from all walks of
          life- from the cashier at your local grocery store to the
          multimillionaire, be able to contribute to a cause that impacted
          billions of people. This is because we believe that to truly solve
          problems that impact the world, the world needs to first lend a helping
          hand.</p>

          <p>Ultimately we realized that there wasn’t a globally accessible
          solution to solve these billion-people impact problems. This
          was when Billion was born.</p>

          <p>Billion combines the immense power of crowdfunding with the
          interactiveness of basketball bracket to pool the world’s resources
          into one fund to benefit the globe.</p>

          <h2>Why Billion</h2>

          <p>Because crowdfunding sites that currently exist are aimed at solving
          smaller issues. Your dollar in the Billion Fund has the chance to
          snowball into a massive opportunity to find solutions to world issues.
          A movement that originally starts as a spark of a brilliant idea in the
          midst of a sea of others, is given a chance to grow and shine with your
          support. The idea behind Billion is finding a solution each year to a
          huge issue. The reason we choose one is because giving a huge fund to a
          movement with huge potential creates bigger impact then spreading the
          fund over several.</p>

          <h2>How Billion Works</h2>

          <h3>Pitch & Rally</h3>

          <p>People and organizations with great ideas pitch their movements to
          be featured on Billion. The top fourteen ideas are selected by the
          Billion team based on the criteria of innovation, impact, and
          viability.</p>

          <p>Once selected, these movements rally their supporters to raise
          money for the Billion Fund. Points are awarded based on the amount of
          money that is raised: each dollar will earn the movement
          <%= pluralize(TransactionsController::DOLLAR_TO_POINT, 'point') %>.
          </p>

          <p>The teams with the most points advance to the next stage of the event: <em>the bracket</em></p>

          <h3>Bracket</h3>
